## Overview

This project implements a people counter system using YOLOv8 for object detection and the SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) algorithm for tracking. The system detects and tracks people in a video feed, counting the number of people passing through specified regions of interest.

## Features

- Object detection and tracking using YOLOv8 and SORT Tracker
- Real-time people counting
- Customizable regions of interest (ROI) for counting people
- Display of count for people crossing predefined lines
- Visual representation of tracking and counting in the video feed

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project is to develop a reliable and efficient system for monitoring the flow of people in various scenarios, such as retail stores, public spaces, events, and more. By accurately counting and tracking people, the system can provide valuable insights for crowd management, security, and resource allocation.
